# productive-flow
An application for guided and encouraged productivity

## About
Developed by me and my brother to combine a set of productivity resources in a meaningful and usable way, 
providing as much guidance as needed to get you working on your most important projects, or planning them
effectively if you need a better idea of what to do next.

## Instructions
Presently **very much under construction**, but projects can be created using either the `dump.py` script or
by running `gui.py` and adding projects in the graphical interface.

In future, projects will be editable from the graphical interface, with plans to automatically identify 
expected choke points, and display projects in a variety of meaningful ways that enable easier planning and
comprehension of what you are and should be working on. Current planned display formats are Gannt chart,
Work Breakdown Structure, and priority queue.

## Resources
The project has been based off ideas from the following resources, as well as some of our own.
- David Allen's *"Getting Things Done: The Art of Stree-Free Productivity"*
- Kelly McGonigal's *"The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works. Why It Matters. and What You Can Do to
Get More of It"*
- Nir Eyal's *"Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life"*
- to be continued... (including source links where possible)
